# pandas-python-jmeter-notebook
Jupyter Notebook for going through Jmeter logs and creating meaningful reports out of them. 

The logs were based off of a performance test ran with Jmeter.

Please excuse the horrible variable names. I was a young programmer when writing this.

Written in Python and I used Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Enjoy!
